  "aboutpara": "With my extensive experience in full-stack development, a deep understanding of cryptocurrency technologies, and a proven track record in database management, I believe I could make a substantial contribution to your team. During my time as a Software Developer at the Center for Advanced Public Safety, I led the design and architecture of the Freedom Narcan Reporting App, a tool that allows first responders to report their location and use of Narcan, using .Net Core 3.1, MySQL, OAuth 2.0, Angular, Typescript, and SASS. My development of a DNA tracking system, which is currently used by all Alabama Collection Agencies and Forensic Science labs, is a testament to my capacity for creating impactful, large-scale solutions. My academic background from The University of Montevallo, where I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Informatics, serves as the backbone of my practical skills. As a dedicated member of the University's Computer Science Club, I demonstrated both my passion for the field and my ability to work collaboratively. I am proficient in numerous programming languages, including but not limited to Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript. Furthermore, I have significant experience with various web technologies such as HTML, CSS/SCSS, Angular, and React, as well as extensive knowledge in database management using SQL. What sets me apart is not just my technical skills and experience, but my perseverance and eagerness to grow. I believe in starting wherever I have to, in order to prove my worth and dedication to my work. I assure you that if given an opportunity, I will not let you down.",
