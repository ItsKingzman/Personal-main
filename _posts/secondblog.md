It consists of a series of interconnected blocks, each containing a group of transactions. Once a block is added to the blockchain, it becomes immutable, ensuring data integrity.
Some key features of blockchain technology include:
1. Decentralization: Blockchain relies on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating the need for a central authority to validate transactions.
2. Security: Transactions in a blockchain are secured using cryptographic techniques, making it difficult for malicious actors to alter the data.
3. Transparency: All participants in a blockchain network have access to the entire transaction history, promoting trust and accountability.
4. Supply Chain Management: Blockchain can provide end-to-end visibility and traceability in supply chains, improving efficiency and reducing fraud.
5. Voting Systems: Blockchain-based voting systems can enhance security and transparency while minimizing the risk of manipulation.
6. Digital Identity Management: Blockchain can provide a secure and decentralized method for managing digital identities, streamlining authentication processes and protecting user privacy.
