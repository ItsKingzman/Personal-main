Containers allow developers to package applications along with their dependencies into a single, lightweight, and portable unit, ensuring that applications run consistently across different environments.
Containers provide the following benefits:
1. Isolation: Containers run in isolation from each other, minimizing conflicts and improving security.
2. Portability: Applications packaged in containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, making it easier to deploy and manage applications across different environments.
3. Scalability: Docker allows developers to quickly scale applications by creating multiple container instances as needed.
