It enables developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with other developers, and revert to previous versions when necessary.
Some key features of Git include:
1. Branching: Git allows developers to create separate branches for different features or bug fixes, enabling parallel development without affecting the main codebase.
2. Merging: Developers can merge branches back into the main codebase after completing their work, ensuring that changes are integrated smoothly.
3. Conflict Resolution: In case of conflicting changes, Git provides tools to help developers resolve conflicts and maintain code integrity.
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides Git repository hosting, collaboration tools, and a social network for developers. It simplifies the process of managing Git repositories and enables developers to collaborate on projects, track issues, and review code.
